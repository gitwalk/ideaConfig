      <item value="1. `spring-core` and `spring-oxm` should be pre-compiled due to repackaged dependencies. See `*RepackJar` tasks in the build and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-160605). 2. `spring-aspects` does not compile due to references to aspect types unknown to IntelliJ IDEA. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-64446 for details. In the meantime, the 'spring-aspects' can be excluded from the project to avoid compilation errors. 3. While JUnit tests pass from the command line with Gradle, some may fail when run from IntelliJ IDEA. Resolving this is a work in progress. If attempting to run all JUnit tests from within IntelliJ IDEA, you will likely need to set the following VM options to avoid out of memory errors: -XX:MaxPermSize=2048m -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxHeapSize=2048m 4. If you invoke &quot;Rebuild Project&quot; in the IDE, you'll have to generate some test resources of the `spring-oxm` module again (`./gradlew :spring-oxm:compileTestJava`)" />
